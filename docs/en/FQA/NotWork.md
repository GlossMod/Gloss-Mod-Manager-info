# What should I do if the mod doesn't work after installation?
Generally, it falls into the following situations:
- You haven't installed the necessary prerequisite plugins for the mod.
  - Solution: Download and install the corresponding prerequisites according to the mod introduction.
  - Some game prerequisites for download: https://cloud.aoe.top/s/KrRfO

- The mod is outdated and no longer compatible with the new version of the game.
  > Solution: There is no solution. Go ask the author to update, or look for someone else who has updated and adapted the mod for the new version of the game.

- You have changed the mod type yourself, causing the manager to install it in the wrong place.
  - In this case, I suggest you uninstall the mod, then add it back to the manager, and reinstall it.
  - I repeat: GMM will automatically recognize the type of mods added to the manager. Do not arbitrarily modify these types!

- The manager has identified the mod of unknown type into the general type.
  - This situation may currently occur in Wolfenstein and Elden Ring.
  - You open the mod directory, then check if there is a compressed package inside another compressed package. Drag the compressed package into the manager for installation.

- You are playing Elden Ring, Armored Core 6, or Animal Crossing, but you have not used the manager to start the game.
  - Solution: Use the manager to start the game.
  - Additionally, Elden Ring and Armored Core 6 require a Steam original game to use mods.

- Resident Evil 2, 3 mods are generally ineffective because the game version and mod version are different.
  - Resident Evil 2, 3 are divided into RT (ray tracing) and DX11_NOT-RT (non-ray tracing).
  - You can judge based on the release time of the mod. Before June 19, 2022, all are DX11_NOT-RT.
  - After June 19, 2022, check if the author has marked (usually RT or NOT-RT). If not, you have to guess.
  - Steam defaults to RT, you can switch to DX11_NOT-RT in the game properties in the Steam library by right-clicking the game -> Properties -> Beta -> Join Beta.
  - Also, the REFramework framework also needs to be compatible with the version.

- Even after confirming everything is correct, the mod is still ineffective.
  - Then it might be a problem with the manager. Join the group and provide detailed feedback, feedback group: 825182128
