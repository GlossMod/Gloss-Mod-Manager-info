## Installing UE4SS

Drag the downloaded UE4SS compressed file (or gmm package) into the manager, and click install.

## Installing Mods

You can download any mods you want from various places. Here are a few websites for downloading Palworld Mods:
- 3DM Mod站: https://mod.3dmgame.com/Palworld
- Nexus Mods: https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods

Then add the downloaded compressed file to the manager for automatic installation and uninstallation.

## Other Issues

Mod not working?
- Please ensure you have installed the necessary prerequisites. Some mods cannot be used on the server, such as the mini-map mod.

Game crashes?
- Using mods carries the risk of causing the game to crash, especially with the current game bugs, which make it easier to crash. Relax your attitude, and you can first check the mods for conflicts, which might be causing the game to crash. It could also be that the mod is too old and not maintained for the current version of the game.

If you have used UE4SS version 2.5.2 and then upgraded to 3.0.1, causing the game not to open, this is due to version compatibility issues with UE4SS. There are two solutions:
- Downgrade UE4SS to version 2.5.2.
- Delete all contents in the `Palworld\Pal\Binaries\Win64` directory, then verify the game's integrity, and reinstall all mods.
