In ensuring that it's not because of your own issues, then continue to look down.

Normally, GMM will automatically help you standardize some improperly packaged Mods into the mod folder, but this cannot solve all problems.

> - Multiple folder levels for multiple files.
> - Automatically filter out a lot of unrelated content to the Mod.

If not, then follow the Mod's instructions for manual installation.
