## Installing REDMod

If your game is downloaded from Steam, you only need to go to the [store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060310/Cyberpunk_2077_REDmod/) to receive this tool, then check it in the DLC.

Then, when starting the game, select "Activate Mod".

## Installing Mods

You can download any mods you want from various websites. Here are a few websites for downloading Cyberpunk 2077 Mods:

- 3DM Mods: https://mod.3dmgame.com/Cyberpunk2077
- Nexus Mods: https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/

Then add the downloaded compressed package to the manager for automatic installation and uninstallation.

## About CET Console

If you are using Mod for the first time, you might see this when you enter the game:

Don't worry, this means CET has been successfully installed. Now CET requires you to set a shortcut key. You can click on the right side of "Unbound", then press any key on your keyboard. (I personally prefer using the `~` key)

After that, you can use `~` to open the console directly.

Most mods (such as clothing, vehicles) will tell you the console code to find their mod items in the game.

You only need to check the mod introduction, copy the code, and paste it (batch paste) into the console to directly get the mod items.
